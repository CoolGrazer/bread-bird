# Why?

The rhythm heaven series are my personal favorites from Nintendo, and when I got a chance to work on a game jam, I had to do it.

# How?

The Godot Game Engine! I could use Unity but....
And I'm pretty comfortable in phython anyways.

# When?

For a game jam, it sure is gonna take a while. The due date is the 25th of March, so by then this should be complete!
